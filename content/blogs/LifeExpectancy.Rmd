#  Life Expectancy Comparison Among Countries

You have seen the `gapminder` dataset that has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. To get a glimpse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function. We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

Your task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` you come from.

I have created the `country_data` and `continent_data` with the code below.

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "China") 

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country you chose. Map `year` on the x-axis, and `lifeExp` on the y-axis. You should also use `geom_point()` to see the actual data points and `geom_smooth(se = FALSE)` to plot the underlying trendlines. You need to remove the comments **\#** from the lines below for your code to run.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
 plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
   NULL 

# plot1
```

Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
 plot1<- plot1 +
   labs(title = "Life Expectancy over Time- China", x = "Year", y = "Life Expectancy") +
   NULL


plot1
```

Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the *continent* you come from. (Hint: map the `country` variable to the colour aesthetic. You also want to map `country` to the `group` aesthetic, so all points for each country are grouped together).

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
 gapminder %>%
 ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x =year , y =lifeExp  , colour=country , group =country))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
        labs(title="Life Expectancy over Time- Aisa", subtitle="By country", x= "Year", y="Life Expectancy" )
   NULL
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
 ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp  , colour= continent ))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   facet_wrap(~continent) +
   theme(legend.position="none") + 
   labs(title="Life Expectancy over Time- World", subtitle="By continent", x="Year", y="Life Expectancy")
   NULL
```

Given these trends, what can you say about life expectancy since 1952? Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

- Overall, life expectancy has continued to increase since 1952 for all continents in the world. However, there are still huge differences between life expectancy across continents- lower in Africa and Aisa, and higher in Europe and Oceania. Also, there are more variances of life expectancy in Africa and Aisa, and lower in Europe and Oceania. I think it is linked to the level of development of the regions and people's lifestyle as well.
